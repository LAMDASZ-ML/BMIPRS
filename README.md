## Highlights

Abstract:** *Vision-language models (VLMs) have exhibited remarkable generalization capabilities, and prompt learning for VLMs has attracted great attention for the ability to adapt pre-trained VLMs to specific downstream tasks. However, existing studies mainly focus on single-modal prompts or uni-directional modality interaction, overlooking the powerful alignment effects resulting from the interaction between the vision and language modalities. To this end, we propose a novel prompt learning method called Bi-directional Modality Interaction Prompt (BMIP), which dynamically weights bi-modal information through learning the information of the attention layer, enhancing trainability and inter-modal consistency compared to simple information aggregation methods. To evaluate the effectiveness of prompt learning methods, we propose a more realistic evaluation paradigm called open-world generalization complementing the widely adopted cross-dataset transfer and domain generalization tasks. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets reveal that BMIP not only outperforms current state-of-the-art methods across all three evaluation paradigms but is also flexible enough to be combined with other prompt-based methods for consistent performance enhancement.* 

## Main Contributions

1) Novel Bi-directional Modality Interaction Technique
   * Enhance the cross-modality alignment and pave the way for further exploration of information aggregation in other multi-modal modelsNew 
2) Evaluation Paradigm: Open-World Generalization
   * Facilitate more realistic evaluations and promote related research 
3) Flexible Integration with Other Methods
   * BMIP is flexible enough to combine with other prompt learning methods, consistently boosting their performance.
4) State-of-the-Art Performance
   * BMIP achieves SOTA performance across all tasks
